# Hi. We're [Form3](https://www.form3.tech/) 👋

![Our Logo](./assets/form3-logo-gopher.png)

We are an award-winning cloud-native payment technology provider for financially regulated business.<br>
We connect those regulated businesses to payment schemes all over the world so that they can deliver amazing products for their customers. <br>
When you look around at how the world has changed, there’s this big divergence. The real economy has moved into a fast-paced, digital, real-time landscape; yet payments technology hasn’t quite kept pace. We are on a mission to redefine what a truly instant payment experience means. 

Why? Because we share an unwavering belief in an API driven payment future.
