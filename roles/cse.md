Between them they are split across projects including:

* SecDevOps Coaching; taking ownership of a development arm and working through implementing, tools, best practices and methodologies to increase knowledge within our teams and the maturity of the products/services.

* Assessing cloud security across our growing public cloud platforms (AWS,GCP, Azure), working with native and third-party tooling to create secure architectures and robust services.

* Hardening our vast microservice architecture, implementing a range of container security tools and also researching and increasing Kubernetes security through a range of techniques with the latest technology.


## Team testimonials:
We are always going to say we are awesome, so don't just take our word for it, below is what some of our Engineers have to say about their time so far at Form3: 

### Gerardo Prieto - Lead Security Engineer

Across my 2 year at Form3, I have been able to tackle complicated problems that are unique to the fintech industry. I have been working through implementation of multi-cloud governance and multi-cloud security controls. As a Lead Security Engineer I am able to work on the company security posture, discuss architecture security with teams, POC tools and help to build a SevDevOps culture across the company. Overall my experience has enabled me to increase my skill-set within cutting edge technology in an industry where security becomes critical.

### Gr√©goire Martinache - Lead Security Engineer 

Since I joined Form3 a year ago, I‚Äôve been able to  work on a wide range of topics, from cloud and pipeline security to building POC tools and doing threat modelling exercises. Most importantly, my colleagues with which I‚Äôm working on those problems are both very knowledgeable and easy to collaborate with. Overall, I‚Äôve learned a lot of new skills, in the stimulating and flexible environment Form3 offers.

### Daniele Muccci - Lead Security Engineer

During my first year in Form3 I had the chance to work on many different task across multiple teams. In particular, I have developed internal security tools, implemented PoCs for adopting new technologies and supported the engineering teams in the complex task of securing our Kubernetes clusters across multiple clouds. As a senior engineer I provide consultancy to other teams while also developing projects within the security team, cooperating with very skilled engineers in both cases. The wide range of challenges and technologies across all the teams I cooperate with allowed me to both increase the breadth of my skill-set and also to specialise in a few critical areas I enjoy.
