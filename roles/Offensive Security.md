# Offensive Security:
We understand we are a target, you don’t move millions of capital daily without attracting some attention, this is where our offensive security team come in. Split into two designated areas; Pentesting and Red Teaming, this team are focused on testing and pushing the boundaries of what our security units can achieve. With our team of 5 in-house OffSec Engineers, we aim to put our security function through simulated-attacks that rival the most sophisticated APT groups.

* Conducting Penetration Tests across the entire estate on both new and existing products, using external testing for audit purposes only, this team are the go-to for ensure our services are meeting our standards. 
* Devising plans, scoping, creating and executing advanced Red Team operations, including custom malware and C2 development. 
* Researching and developing new attack methods on cutting edge technology to increase the bar for security within Form3. 

## Team testimonials:
We are always going to say we are awesome, so don't just take our word for it, below is what some of our Engineers have to say about their time so far at Form3:  

### Marcell Molnar - Offensive Security Engineer

I have been part of the ethical hacking team at Form3 for more than two years now, in fact I was one of its first members. 
During these two years there have been some exciting changes in the technologies we use. I had a chance to see projects through from the initial design draft to the final pentest before release. It was a great experience to work so closely with the engineers and to be able to work on every aspect of security design and implementation. 
Besides pentesting the team also works on red team projects. Given our unique remote work environment this poses some challenges, but it also allowed me to try and implement solutions that have not been used before anywhere else.
Between projects we get a chance to do our own research, work on new tools and techniques. This has given me the freedom to experiment and create tooling that makes our job easier and is unique to our environment. 
This freedom and flexibility has allowed me to grow professionally and creates a great dynamic in our team.
